# Welcome to my collection

This is home to my trading card collection. I mainly collect baseball, but have interest in various other sports as well. 

## Sections of the site

### [Personal Collection](/pc)
This section contains pages dedicated to my collection to my favorite players. These are players that I collect as many different cards as I can.

### [Set Registry](/set-registry)
This section contains various interests in my collection. For example, I am trying to collect a signed baseball card of every person in the Milwaukee Brewers Wall of Fame. Some of these pages are for specific players and others are dedicated to other pursuits.

### [Complete Collection](/collection)
This section contains pages for every set that I have cards from. Not every card in every set is here (yet).
